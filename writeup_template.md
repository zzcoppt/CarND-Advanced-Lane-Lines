**Advanced Lane Finding Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  [Here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines/blob/master/writeup_template.md) is a template writeup for this project you can use as a guide and a starting point.  

You're reading it!

### Camera Calibration

#### 1. Briefly state how you computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. Provide an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.

The code for this step is contained in 22 line of file called "utils.py" .  
```
def calibrate(images,grid=(9,6)):
    object_points=[]
    img_points = []
    for img in images:
        object_point = np.zeros( (grid[0]*grid[1],3),np.float32 )
        object_point[:,:2]= np.mgrid[0:grid[0],0:grid[1]].T.reshape(-1,2)
        gray = cv2.cvtColor(img,cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
        ret, corners = cv2.findChessboardCorners(gray, grid, None)
        if ret:
            object_points.append(object_point)
            img_points.append(corners)
    return object_points,object_pointsv
```
I start by preparing "object points", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  `imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.  

I then used the output `object_points` and `object_points` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function.  I applied this distortion correction to the test image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result:

### Pipeline (single images)

#### 1. Provide an example of a distortion-corrected image.

Here is the code that I apply the undistortion methon to the test images:
```
cal_imgs = utils.get_images_by_dir('camera_cal')
object_points,img_points = utils.calibrate(cal_imgs,grid=(9,6))

test_imgs = utils.get_images_by_dir('test_images')

undistorted = []
for img in test_imgs:
    img = utils.cal_undistort(img,object_points,img_points)
    undistorted.append(img)
```
This is how the result look like:
![alt text][image2]

#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you used color transforms, gradients or other methods to create a thresholded binary image.  Provide an example of a binary image result.
First I use the x abs_sobel_thresh to generate generate a binary image:
```
def abs_sobel_thresh(img, orient='x', thresh_min=0, thresh_max=255):
    # Convert to grayscale
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY)
    # Apply x or y gradient with the OpenCV Sobel() function
    # and take the absolute value
    if orient == 'x':
        abs_sobel = np.absolute(cv2.Sobel(gray, cv2.CV_64F, 1, 0))
    if orient == 'y':
        abs_sobel = np.absolute(cv2.Sobel(gray, cv2.CV_64F, 0, 1))
    # Rescale back to 8 bit integer
    scaled_sobel = np.uint8(255*abs_sobel/np.max(abs_sobel))
    # Create a copy and apply the threshold
    binary_output = np.zeros_like(scaled_sobel)
    # Here I'm using inclusive (>=, <=) thresholds, but exclusive is ok too
    binary_output[(scaled_sobel >= thresh_min) & (scaled_sobel <= thresh_max)] = 1

    # Return the result
    return binary_output
```
```
x_thresh = utils.abs_sobel_thresh(img, orient='x', thresh_min=35, thresh_max=100)
```
And I get a result look like this:
![alt text][image3]

It seems that it lose track of the lane line when the road color and the line color are lighter.(You could see it in 3rd,6th,7th image)

Then I use the magnitude threshholds to see how well it does to capture the lane line:
```
def mag_thresh(img, sobel_kernel=3, mag_thresh=(0, 255)):
    # Convert to grayscale
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY)
    # Take both Sobel x and y gradients
    sobelx = cv2.Sobel(gray, cv2.CV_64F, 1, 0, ksize=sobel_kernel)
    sobely = cv2.Sobel(gray, cv2.CV_64F, 0, 1, ksize=sobel_kernel)
    # Calculate the gradient magnitude
    gradmag = np.sqrt(sobelx**2 + sobely**2)
    # Rescale to 8 bit
    scale_factor = np.max(gradmag)/255 
    gradmag = (gradmag/scale_factor).astype(np.uint8) 
    # Create a binary image of ones where threshold is met, zeros otherwise
    binary_output = np.zeros_like(gradmag)
    binary_output[(gradmag >= mag_thresh[0]) & (gradmag <= mag_thresh[1])] = 1

    # Return the binary image
    return binary_output

```
```
mag_thresh = utils.mag_thresh(img, sobel_kernel=9, mag_thresh=(50, 100))
```
Here is the result I got:
![alt text][image4]

Still not capable of capture the lane line where both the road and lane color are light.(See 3rd,6th,7th image)

So I turn to direction threshholds:
```
def dir_threshold(img, sobel_kernel=3, thresh=(0, np.pi/2)):
    # Grayscale
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY)
    # Calculate the x and y gradients
    sobelx = cv2.Sobel(gray, cv2.CV_64F, 1, 0, ksize=sobel_kernel)
    sobely = cv2.Sobel(gray, cv2.CV_64F, 0, 1, ksize=sobel_kernel)
    # Take the absolute value of the gradient direction, 
    # apply a threshold, and create a binary image result
    absgraddir = np.arctan2(np.absolute(sobely), np.absolute(sobelx))
    binary_output =  np.zeros_like(absgraddir)
    binary_output[(absgraddir >= thresh[0]) & (absgraddir <= thresh[1])] = 1

    # Return the binary image
    return binary_output
```
```
dir_thresh = utils.dir_threshold(img, sobel_kernel=21, thresh=(0.7, 1.3))
```

I used a combination of color and gradient thresholds to generate a binary image (thresholding steps at lines # through # in `another_file.py`).  Here's an example of my output for this step.  (note: this is not actually from one of the test images)



#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.

The code for my perspective transform includes a function called `warper()`, which appears in lines 1 through 8 in the file `example.py` (output_images/examples/example.py) (or, for example, in the 3rd code cell of the IPython notebook).  The `warper()` function takes as inputs an image (`img`), as well as source (`src`) and destination (`dst`) points.  I chose the hardcode the source and destination points in the following manner:

```python
src = np.float32(
    [[(img_size[0] / 2) - 55, img_size[1] / 2 + 100],
    [((img_size[0] / 6) - 10), img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] * 5 / 6) + 60, img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] / 2 + 55), img_size[1] / 2 + 100]])
dst = np.float32(
    [[(img_size[0] / 4), 0],
    [(img_size[0] / 4), img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] * 3 / 4), img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] * 3 / 4), 0]])
```
Here is the result I got:
![alt text][image4]

This resulted in the following source and destination points:

| Source        | Destination   | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:| 
| 585, 460      | 320, 0        | 
| 203, 720      | 320, 720      |
| 1127, 720     | 960, 720      |
| 695, 460      | 960, 0        |

I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by drawing the `src` and `dst` points onto a test image and its warped counterpart to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image.

#### 4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?

Then I did some other stuff and fit my lane lines with a 2nd order polynomial kinda like this:

![alt text][image5]

#### 5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.

I did this in lines # through # in my code in `my_other_file.py`

#### 6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.

I implemented this step in lines # through # in my code in `yet_another_file.py` in the function `map_lane()`.  Here is an example of my result on a test image:

### Pipeline (video)

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).

Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video.mp4)

---

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
